I followed the pseudocode given in the assignment very closely. I also did the
extra credit using the implementation given to us. On my machine my program
took ~27 seconds. Nineteen of the crytoquips scored 100 and one scored 95.

I created another search method that takes the number of words to match as an
argument. I have the default search method call this new recursive method.
	private int[] search(final int numberOfWordsToMatch)

The cryptoquip with the worst performance was the 12th one.
	# of calls to search(cipherwords.size()): 265
	# of calls to search(cipherwords.size() - 1): 1491
	
If I wanted to improve the performance, I would keep track of the best answer
with the most matched words as I am searching for all words. If not all words
are matched at the end, I would simply return the best answer that was found
along the way to eliminate the extra call to search. I think that this would
decrease the accuracy of the answer but it would be a good tradeoff for longer
cryptoquips.
